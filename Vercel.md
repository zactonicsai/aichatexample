## Prompt: Create an Chatbot using claude ai

Let me plan how to help the user with Claude AI API integration using the AI SDK:

1. Project Structure:

1. We'll need to create a simple Next.js application that demonstrates how to use Claude AI with the AI SDK
2. We'll focus on the latest Claude 3.7 Sonnet model which has advanced reasoning capabilities
3. We'll show both basic text generation and chat functionality



2. Styling:

1. We'll use Tailwind CSS with shadcn/ui components for a clean interface
2. We'll create a simple UI that allows the user to interact with Claude



3. Frameworks and Libraries:

1. Next.js App Router
2. AI SDK with Anthropic provider
3. shadcn/ui for components



4. Implementation:

1. Create an API route for Claude integration
2. Create a simple UI for interacting with Claude
3. Show how to use Claude's reasoning capabilities
4. Demonstrate both text generation and chat interfaces




Let me create a comprehensive example that shows how to integrate Claude AI using the AI SDK.
### Using Claude AI with the AI SDK

The AI SDK makes it easy to integrate Anthropic's Claude models into your applications. Claude 3.7 Sonnet is Anthropic's most intelligent model to date and the first Claude model to offer extended thinking—the ability to solve complex problems with careful, step-by-step reasoning .

Let me show you how to integrate Claude AI into a Next.js application using the AI SDK.

## Basic Setup

First, let's create a simple Next.js application that demonstrates how to use Claude AI with the AI SDK:

```typescriptreact project="claude_ai_demo"
...
```

## Installation

To use Claude AI with the AI SDK, you'll need to install the necessary packages:

```shellscript
npm install ai @ai-sdk/anthropic
```

## Key Features

### 1. Text Generation with Claude

The example above demonstrates how to use Claude 3.7 Sonnet for text generation with the AI SDK. The key components are:

- Using `generateText` from the AI SDK to generate text responses 
- Enabling Claude's extended thinking capability for complex reasoning 
- Displaying both the final response and the reasoning process


### 2. Chat Interface with Claude

The chat interface demonstrates:

- Using the `useChat` hook from the AI SDK for managing chat state 
- Streaming responses for a better user experience
- Configuring Claude with extended thinking for more thoughtful responses


### 3. Extended Thinking

Claude 3.7 Sonnet introduces extended thinking—the ability to solve complex problems with careful, step-by-step reasoning . You can enable it using the `thinking` provider option:

```typescript
const providerOptions = {
  anthropic: {
    thinking: { type: 'enabled', budgetTokens: 12000 },
  } as AnthropicProviderOptions
};
```

This allows Claude to take more time to think through complex problems, resulting in more accurate and thoughtful responses.

## How It Works

1. The AI SDK provides a unified API to call any LLM, including Claude 
2. The `generateText` function is used for one-time text generation
3. The `streamText` function is used for streaming responses in chat interfaces
4. The `useChat` hook manages chat state and UI updates


## Advanced Features

### Computer Use

Claude 3.5 Sonnet and later models support Computer Use, which allows the model to interact with computers like humans do - moving cursors, clicking buttons, and typing text . This capability enables automation of complex tasks while leveraging Claude's advanced reasoning abilities.

To implement Computer Use, you would need to:

1. Set up a controlled environment for execution
2. Implement core functionality like mouse control and keyboard input
3. Handle screenshot capture and processing


## Next Steps

After implementing this basic integration, you might want to explore:

1. Adding more advanced features like tool use with Claude
2. Implementing retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) for more accurate responses
3. Fine-tuning the model for your specific use case
4. Implementing Computer Use for more complex interactions


The AI SDK makes it easy to switch between different AI providers by changing just a few lines of code, so you can experiment with different models to find the best fit for your application

### Adding an Anthropic API Key for Claude Integration

To use Claude AI with the AI SDK, you'll need to obtain an Anthropic API key and add it to your project. Here's a step-by-step guide:

## 1. Get an Anthropic API Key

1. Go to [Anthropic's website](https://www.anthropic.com/) and sign up for an account
2. Navigate to the API section in your dashboard
3. Create a new API key
4. Copy the API key to a secure location (you'll only see it once)


## 2. Add the API Key to Your Project

### Using Environment Variables (Local Development)

Create a `.env.local` file in the root of your project and add your Anthropic API key:

```plaintext
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
```

Make sure to add `.env.local` to your `.gitignore` file to prevent accidentally committing your API key.

### Using Vercel Environment Variables (Deployment)

For deployment on Vercel, you should add the API key as an environment variable:

 .```markdown project="Claude API Integration" file="README.md"
...
```

2. Install dependencies:

```shellscript
npm install
```


3. Set up environment variables:
Create a `.env.local` file with the following:

```plaintext
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your_anthropic_api_key
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key
```


4. Start the development server:

```shellscript
npm run dev
```


5. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser


## Usage Examples

### Text Generation

Ask specific questions about the vegan black bean recipes:

- "What ingredients do I need for black bean burgers?"
- "How do I make vegan black bean soup?"
- "Are there any dessert recipes using black beans?"
- "What's the nutritional information for the black bean brownies?"


### Chat Interface

Have a conversation about the recipes:

- "I want to make something with black beans for dinner."
- "Do any of these recipes take less than 30 minutes to prepare?"
- "Which recipe has the highest protein content?"


### Recipe Browser

Browse all available recipes and view their details on the `/recipes` page.

## How This Project Was Generated

This project was created using v0, Vercel's AI-powered coding assistant. The development process involved:

1. **Initial Setup**: Creating a Next.js application with the AI SDK and Claude integration
2. **Data Creation**: Generating sample vegan black bean recipes
3. **RAG Implementation**: Building the retrieval system to find relevant recipes
4. **UI Development**: Creating the text generation, chat, and recipe browsing interfaces
5. **API Integration**: Connecting the frontend to Claude via the AI SDK


v0 helped generate the code, structure the project, and implement best practices for AI integration.

## Technical Details

### AI SDK Integration

The project uses the AI SDK to interact with Claude:

```typescript
import { anthropic } from '@ai-sdk/anthropic';
import { generateText } from 'ai';

const { text } = await generateText({
  model: anthropic('claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219'),
  system: systemPrompt,
  prompt,
  providerOptions: {
    anthropic: {
      thinking: { type: "enabled", budgetTokens: 12000 },
    }
  },
});
```

### Extended Thinking

The application leverages Claude's extended thinking capability for more thoughtful responses. This allows Claude to take more time to reason through complex questions about recipes.

### Recipe Search

The current implementation uses a simple keyword-based search:

```typescript
export function searchRecipes(query: string, limit = 3) {
  const queryTerms = query.toLowerCase().split(" ")
  
  // Score each recipe based on how many query terms it contains
  const scoredRecipes = veganBlackBeanRecipes.map((recipe) => {
    const recipeText = `
      ${recipe.title.toLowerCase()}
      ${recipe.ingredients.join(" ").toLowerCase()}
      ${recipe.instructions.join(" ").toLowerCase()}
      ${recipe.tags.join(" ").toLowerCase()}
    `

    let score = 0
    for (const term of queryTerms) {
      if (recipeText.includes(term)) {
        score += 1
      }
    }

    return { recipe, score }
  })

  // Sort by score and return the top results
  return scoredRecipes
    .sort((a, b) => b.score - a.score)
    .slice(0, limit)
    .map((item) => item.recipe)
}
```

A more advanced implementation would use vector embeddings for semantic search.

## Future Improvements

- Implement proper vector embeddings for more accurate semantic search
- Add a database for storing recipes and user interactions
- Create an admin interface for managing recipes
- Add user authentication and personalized recipe recommendations
- Implement recipe ratings and reviews
